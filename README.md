# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Technologies & Rules
- `yarn --version` --> 1.22.4
- `node --version` --> v14.1.0
- we will use nodejs backend
- DB to be decided
- **Rules**:
  - We will use [Issues](https://github.com/aristofanischionis/ministry-of-labor-and-social-affairs/issues), create new Issues so that we can organize what we need to do.
  - We will use branches.
  - Each branch will be named: `feature/{the-feature-name}`
  - We will only be pushing **working and tested code** in the branches.
  - When a branch is ready, the responsible for this branch will open a **Pull Request**.
  - The other two are going to **review the code** and ask for changes.
  - The responsible will make the changes and the reviewers will accept the changes and **merge & squash** the branch into develop.
  - The develop branch should be merged to master once it is in a good working condition.
  -  Every commit message should start with an **action verb** and describe what is the purpose of this commit. (ex. Add a navigation bar there bla bla).
  -  **Only use English**.
  -  If you have questions ask.
  -  Let's all follow good principles both in coding and collaboration through Git.
