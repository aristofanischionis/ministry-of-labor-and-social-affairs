## Technologies & Rules
- `yarn --version` --> 1.22.4
- `node --version` --> v14.1.0
- we will use nodejs backend
- **Rules**:
  - We will use [Issues](https://github.com/aristofanischionis/ministry-of-labor-and-social-affairs/issues), create new Issues so that we can organize what we need to do.
  - We will use branches.
  - Each branch will be named: `feature/{the-feature-name}`
  - We will only be pushing **working and tested code** in the branches.
  - When a branch is ready, the responsible for this branch will open a **Pull Request**.
  - The other two are going to **review the code** and ask for changes.
  - The responsible will make the changes and the reviewers will accept the changes and **merge & squash** the branch into develop.
  - The develop branch should be merged to master once it is in a good working condition.
  -  Every commit message should start with an **action verb** and describe what is the purpose of this commit. (ex. Add a navigation bar there bla bla).
  -  **Only use English**.
  -  If you have questions ask.
  -  Let's all follow good principles both in coding and collaboration through Git.
